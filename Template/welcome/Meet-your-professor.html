<h2>Priyamvada (Pia) Tripathi</h2>
<p>Hello, and welcome! My name is Priyamvada (Pia) Tripathi. In sanskrit "Priya" means dear and "vada" means speaker so my name is priya-m-vada (m is joining letter) and it means one who speaks dear! Interestingly that is how my students describe me :)</p>
<p><strong>Why I Teach:</strong></p>

<p>Education is a transformative force, and I feel deeply humbled and grateful for the privilege of being educated at some of the finest institutions, guided by exceptional professors. Education is empowering—it has the potential to change lives, yet millions of children around the world still lack access to it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I am inspired by the philosophy of the old man in <em>The Bridge Builder</em> by Will Allen Dromgoole. After crossing a treacherous stream, he stops to build a bridge for those who will follow, saying, “This bridge is not for me but for the young who will come after.” Education, to me, embodies this same selfless act of creating pathways for others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What to Expect from Me:</strong></p>
<p>My teaching philosophy focuses on fostering connections and cultivating a love for learning. A classroom should be a space for exploration and growth, not a place of stress or punishment. I emphasize clarity, engagement, and support, designing lectures and assignments that encourage critical thinking and active participation.</p>
<p>I incorporate practical examples to connect theory with real-world applications and maintain an open-door policy for questions and feedback. My goal is to make each class meaningful and interactive, creating an environment where students feel supported and motivated to learn.</p>
