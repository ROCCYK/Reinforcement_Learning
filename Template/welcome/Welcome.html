<!-- Start of Welcome Message -->
<h1 class="text-center">Welcome to "Reinforcement Learning"!</h1>
<p class="text-center">Explore why reinforcement learning is a cornerstone of modern AI.</p>
<!-- Course Introduction --><hr>

<h2 style="text-align: center; margin: 10px;">Why Study Reinforcement Learning?</h2>
</div>
<p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is at the forefront of artificial intelligence, powering technologies like self-driving cars, recommendation systems, and game-playing AI agents. By studying RL, you'll gain insights into how machines learn through interactions and adapt to their environments. This course will prepare you to design, implement, and evaluate RL models, a skill set highly sought after in industries like robotics, finance, and gaming.</p>
<p>Imagine building systems that can make decisions as effectively as humans—or even better. This is the power of reinforcement learning, and by the end of this course, you’ll have the tools to tackle some of the most challenging and exciting problems in AI.</p>
<!-- What to Expect --><hr>
<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 offset-md-2" style="margin-bottom: 60px;">
<h2 style="text-align: center; margin: 10px;">What to Look Forward To</h2>
</div>
<p>Throughout this course, you’ll dive into key topics like Markov Decision Processes, Q-Learning, Policy Gradients, and advanced RL techniques. You'll work on hands-on projects that will challenge you to think critically and apply concepts in real-world scenarios. By the end, you'll have a portfolio of projects to showcase your skills.</p>
