## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ROCCYK/Reinforcement_Learning.git
   cd Reinforcement_Learning
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv rl_env
   source rl_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: rl_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: If `requirements.txt` is not present, manually install the necessary packages as per the assignment instructions.*
